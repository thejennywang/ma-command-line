wc stands for 'word count' and prints the line count, word count, and character count of a file. An extension of this command is wc -l which prints only the line count of a file.

Counting words in a file works like this:
wc filename

The output would look like this:
      18      86     488 mv
  This means there are 18 lines, 86 words and 488 characters in the file 'mv'

Counting lines in a file works like this:
wc -l filename

The output would look like this:
      18 mv
