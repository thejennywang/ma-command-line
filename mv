# The mv command moves and remove files. 

# To move a file (file) to another directory (folder) and give it a new name (newname), type the following:

mv file folder/newname


# To move a file to another directory, keeping the same name, type the following:

mv file folder


#To rename a file, type the following:

mv file newname

# This renames the 'file' file to 'newname'. 
# If a file named 'newname' already exists, its old contents are replaced with those of the 'newname' file.
